MastiskaTrack is a web-based application for assessing the mental health status of the user. Using sentiment analysis, the model draws 
conclusion which is then passed to a generative model which suggests a course of action based on the user's mental health status.

Our teams aim is to bridge the barrier between the help seekers and the stigma surrounding any mental health discussions.

It is a free to use, easily accesible solution catering to the initial screening phase and helping with further course of action
that needs to be carried out in order to seek help or for a overall better well-being.
